# Gaussian-Wave-Propagation
This repository houses a computational optics project that numerically simulates the paraxial propagation and manipulation of a Gaussian laser beam using the Angular Spectrum Method implemented in MATLAB. The core functionality validates the analytical expansion of the beam radius w(z) and the fundamental Rayleigh distance z_0 against simulation data. Furthermore, the code models the interaction of the beam with a parabolic reflector by applying a quadratic phase transformation, enabling the analysis of complex optical paths, including wave front focusing, intensity redistribution, and the study of reflected beam dynamics essential for predicting performance in structured optical systems.
